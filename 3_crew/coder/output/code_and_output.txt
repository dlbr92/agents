# Python program to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series
# 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... and multiply total by 4

total = 0.0

for i in range(10000):
    term = 1 / (2 * i + 1)  # The odd denominator
    if i % 2 == 0:
        total += term  # Add the term for even indices
    else:
        total -= term  # Subtract the term for odd indices

final_result = total * 4

print(final_result)

Output:
